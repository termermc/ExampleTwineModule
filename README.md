# ExampleTwineModule
Twine module demonstrating basic Twine features

## What does it do, what is it for?
All sorts of things! Check out Module.java to see! Go ahead and clone the repository and play around with the code yourself, it's all documented very well with comments.

## How do I get/compile it?
Run `./gradlew build`, and the Module will be compiled into the `build/libs/` folder of the project.

## Deploying
Just drop the jar into Twine's `modules/` directory, and start.
