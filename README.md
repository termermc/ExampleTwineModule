# ExampleTwineModule
Twine module demonstrating basic Twine features

## What does it do, what is it for?
All sorts of things! Check out Module.java to see! Go ahead and clone the repository and play around with the code yourself, it's all documented very well with comments.

## How do I get/compile it?
You can either run `mvn install` (if you have Maven installed) and check for a jar file in `target/`, or import the project into your favorite IDE, include Twine in your build path, and compile to a jar without dependencies.

## Deploying
Just drop the jar into Twine's `modules/` directory, and start.
